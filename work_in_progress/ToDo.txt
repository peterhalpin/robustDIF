robustDIF to do:

Short term
- Create rdif object class (S3)
- print.rdif method that prints just estimate (to be added, also its SE).
- plot.rdif method that calls rho_grid and plots rho agaist theta
- summary.rdif method that pretty-prints results of dif_test and appends a paragraph with output of delta_test (similar to summary.lm).
- check documentation for errors
- update README files on github.
- Submit to CRAN

Long term
- Create github.io page for pacakge
- Two user vignettes, one for DIF testing and one for delta_test
- Support for additional models (rasch, GPMC)
- Cluster robust SEs from mirt
